# 1 Introduction

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

Text…

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

PROS: 
-As opposed to the other coverage tools, we found EclEmma easy to set up and integrate with the Eclipse IDE
-it provided various coverage metrics such as statement coverage, branch coverage which allowed us to asses the quality of our tests and make new tests to improve the coverage metrics.
-it provided a detailed report and outlined all the areas of the ode that weren't outlined by the code 

CONS: 
- the eclemma tool provided a coverage without the condition coverage

Statement Coverage Metric
PROS:
- it provided a basic measure of how much of the code has been executed by the test cases. 
- it was easy to understand and interpret

CONS: 
- it does not ensure that all possible execution paths in the code have been tested, 

Branch Coverage Metric
PROS: it provided a more detailed measure of test coverage by evaluating whether all possible outcomes of various decision points in the code have been tested.

CONS: it does not not guarantee comprehensive testing of all possible code paths, as it focuses on decision points rather then individual condition within the decisions
